# Infinite Field

Infinite Field is a high-frequency trading firm. We build ultra-low-latency systems for execution at scale. Performance is everything.

We prioritize practical solutions over theory. If something works and delivers results, that’s what matters. Performance is always the goal, and every piece of code is written with efficiency and longevity in mind.

If you specialize in performance-critical software, understand systems down to the bare metal, and know how to optimize x64 assembly, we’d love to hear from you.
